In this game, players repeat a sequence of colored lights that flash on the game unit. The game gets harder as more lights flash at once and the sequence gets faster. Players earn points for each correct sequence, and the game saves the player's highest score. The game can be played solo or with multiple players taking turns.when player mistake the sequence then  game is stoped,again start game ,we can press any key.
